Free plan provides 10 GB of data per month (if you confirm your email address), and the Pro plan has unlimited data and access to servers in over 112 cities in 69 countries.\n\nStill not convinced? Perhaps this elegant list of features will convince you otherwise.\n\nStop tracking and browse privately\nGovernments block content based on your location. Corporations track and sell your personal data. Add Windscribe to your browser and take back control of your privacy.\n\nAdvanced Privacy Features\nWindscribe is not just a proxy extension. It's a suite of privacy tools which include:\n\nAd + Tracker Blocking - Ads and trackers follow you around, waste your bandwidth and compromise your privacy. Windscribe will block all this crap.\nMalware Blocking - Some sites distribute malware. We'll prevent you from ever ending up on those sites.\nSocial Blocking - Social networks are the biggest privacy invaders out there. Block their trackers.\nWhitelisting - Our block lists are not one size fits all. Customize your experience.\nLocation API Spoofing - Sites can request your GPS location why bypasses most proxies and VPNs. Not with Windscribe.\nWebRTC Blocking - Prevents WebRTC leaks that plague most proxy extensions and VPNs.\nTimezone Spoofing - Sites can detect that your IP doesn't match your browser's time zone. This feature solves this problem.\nNotification Blocking - Tired for sites asking you to send notifications? We are too. Enable this feature to never see those things again.\nUser Agent Spoofing - Helps combat browser fingerprinting\nCookie Monitoring - Leave nothing behind. This feature deletes 1st or 3rd party cookies when you close the tab.\nLanguage Spoofing - This feature will spoof your browser's language settings to match the proxy location of your choice.\n\nUnlock geo-restricted content\nWindscribe VPN masks your IP address. This gives you unrestricted and private access to entertainment, news sites, and blocked content in over 63 different countries.\n\nNo identifying logs\nYour privacy is a right. We don‚Äôt track you. We don't sell your data to marketers, or even share it with anyone. We don‚Äôt keep logs that can deanonymize you.\n\nGo beyond basic VPN protection\nFor comprehensive privacy protection even outside of the browser, use our desktop VPN applications (they‚Äôre also free). Available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Did we mention mobile? Yeah, there's mobile apps too.\n\n--------------\n\nHaving issues with Windscribe VPN or want to suggest something?
